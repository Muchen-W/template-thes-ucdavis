A University of California at Davis Thesis/Dissertation Template

Please read the manual ucdavisthesis.pdf for more information and change log.

The ucdavisthesis class is a LaTeX class that allows you to create a 
dissertation or thesis which conforms (to the best of my knowledge) to 
UC Davis formatting requirements as of April 2016. The output document
has the necessary preliminary pages, margins, page number placement, etc.
This class also provides most of the macros available in the report class on 
which it is based, allowing for chapters, sections, etc. Please check the
Graduate Studies web page (http://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/students/filing.html) 
for any changes or updates to their requirements.
